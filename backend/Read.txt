to use cloudinary we need packages like multer, cloudinary, streamifier
multer: to handle file uploads
cloudinary: to upload files to cloudinary api
streamifier: to convert chunks of data to stream

npm install multer cloudinary streamifier


to link frontend and backend, we are using redux, i.e redux thunks
https://redux.js.org/usage/writing-logic-thunks
to install them, rum the command,

cd frontend
npm i react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit axios

"src": "/(.*)", //regular expression, matching all the routes

"dest": "server.js" ==> send all requests to sever.js

"config": {
            "distDir": "dist"
        } ---> storing output files in the dist folder
